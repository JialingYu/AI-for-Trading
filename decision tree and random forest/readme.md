# Radom forest for alpha generation

## Decision Tree

Seperate a set of data points with different features into different categories by asking yes no questions on one feature at a time. The feature is chosen in the order that the separation has the largest information gain, i.e., we minimise the impurity of the set in the fastest direction at each step.
