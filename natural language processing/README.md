**why use it?**

Unlike math and computer language which is structured, human language are ambiguious and unstructured, which makes computer difficult to understand.  
Despite that, computer can still do something to understand unstructured human language such as the following:
- process words and phrases, try to identify keywords, part of speech, name entities, quantities, etc.
- parse sentence to extract relevant parts of sentence, questions, statements
- analyse document vto find frequent and rare words, assess tone and sentiment, cluster and group relevant documents together.

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

```python
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
